This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

# clipboard.js

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/clipboard.js/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/clipboard.js)
![Killing Flash](https://img.shields.io/badge/killing-flash-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

> Modern copy to clipboard. No Flash. Just 3kb gzipped.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/"><img width="728" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/16165747/a0f6fc46-349a-11e6-8c9b-c5fd58d9099c.png" alt="Demo"></a>

## Why

Copying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.

That's why clipboard.js exists.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install clipboard --save
```

Or if you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

First, include the script located on the `dist` folder or load it from [a third-party CDN provider](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/wiki/CDN-Providers).

```html
<script src="dist/clipboard.min.js"></script>
```

Now, you need to instantiate it by [passing a DOM selector](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-selector.html#L18), [HTML element](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-node.html#L16-L17), or [list of HTML elements](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/blob/master/demo/constructor-nodelist.html#L18-L19).

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn');
```

Internally, we need to fetch all elements that matches with your selector and attach event listeners for each one. But guess what? If you have hundreds of matches, this operation can consume a lot of memory.

For this reason we use [event delegation](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687296/what-is-dom-event-delegation) which replaces multiple event listeners with just a single listener. After all, [#perfmatters](https://twitter.com/hashtag/perfmatters).

# Usage

We're living a _declarative renaissance_, that's why we decided to take advantage of [HTML5 data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) for better usability.

### Copy text from another element

A pretty common use case is to copy content from another element. You can do that by adding a `data-clipboard-target` attribute in your trigger element.

The value you include on this attribute needs to match another's element selector.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-target"><img width="473" alt="example-2" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/9983467/a4946aaa-5fb1-11e5-9780-f09fcd7ca6c8.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Target -->
<input id="foo" value="https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js.git">

<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-target="#foo">
    <img src="assets/clippy.svg" alt="Copy to clipboard">
</button>
```

### Cut text from another element

Additionally, you can define a `data-clipboard-action` attribute to specify if you want to either `copy` or `cut` content.

If you omit this attribute, `copy` will be used by default.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-action"><img width="473" alt="example-3" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000358/7df57b9c-6050-11e5-9cd1-fbc51d2fd0a7.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Target -->
<textarea id="bar">Mussum ipsum cacilds...</textarea>

<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-action="cut" data-clipboard-target="#bar">
    Cut to clipboard
</button>
```

As you may expect, the `cut` action only works on `<input>` or `<textarea>` elements.

### Copy text from attribute

Truth is, you don't even need another element to copy its content from. You can just include a `data-clipboard-text` attribute in your trigger element.

<a href="https://clipboardjs.com/#example-text"><img width="147" alt="example-1" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10000347/6e16cf8c-6050-11e5-9883-1c5681f9ec45.png"></a>

```html
<!-- Trigger -->
<button class="btn" data-clipboard-text="Just because you can doesn't mean you should — clipboard.js">
    Copy to clipboard
</button>
```

## Events

There are cases where you'd like to show some user feedback or capture what has been selected after a copy/cut operation.

That's why we fire custom events such as `success` and `error` for you to listen and implement your custom logic.

```js
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');

clipboard.on('success', function(e) {
    console.info('Action:', e.action);
    console.info('Text:', e.text);
    console.info('Trigger:', e.trigger);

    e.clearSelection();
});

clipboard.on('error', function(e) {
    console.error('Action:', e.action);
    console.error('Trigger:', e.trigger);
});
```

For a live demonstration, go to this [site](https://clipboardjs.com/) and open your console.

## Tooltips

Each application has different design needs, that's why clipboard.js does not include any CSS or built-in tooltip solution.

The tooltips you see on the [demo site](https://clipboardjs.com/) were built using [GitHub's Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer-css/tree/master/modules/primer-tooltips). You may want to check that out if you're looking for a similar look and feel.

## Advanced Options

If you don't want to modify your HTML, there's a pretty handy imperative API for you to use. All you need to do is declare a function, do your thing, and return a value.

For instance, if you want to dynamically set a `target`, you'll need to return a Node.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    target: function(trigger) {
        return trigger.nextElementSibling;
    }
});
```

If you want to dynamically set a `text`, you'll return a String.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    text: function(trigger) {
        return trigger.getAttribute('aria-label');
    }
});
```

For use in Bootstrap Modals or with any other library that changes the focus you'll want to set the focused element as the `container` value.

```js
new ClipboardJS('.btn', {
    container: document.getElementById('modal')
});
```

Also, if you are working with single page apps, you may want to manage the lifecycle of the DOM more precisely. Here's how you clean up the events and objects that we create.

```js
var clipboard = new ClipboardJS('.btn');
clipboard.destroy();
```

## Browser Support

This library relies on both [Selection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) and [execCommand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand) APIs. The first one is [supported by all browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=selection) while the second one is supported in the following browsers.

| <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/chrome.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Chrome logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/edge.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Edge logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/firefox.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Firefox logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/ie.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Internet Explorer logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/opera.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Opera logo"> | <img src="https://clipboardjs.com/assets/images/safari.png" width="48px" height="48px" alt="Safari logo"> |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 42+ ✔ | 12+ ✔ | 41+ ✔ | 9+ ✔ | 29+ ✔ | 10+ ✔ |

The good news is that clipboard.js gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers. All you have to do is show a tooltip saying `Copied!` when `success` event is called and `Press Ctrl+C to copy` when `error` event is called because the text is already selected.

You can also check if clipboard.js is supported or not by running `ClipboardJS.isSupported()`, that way you can hide copy/cut buttons from the UI.

## Bonus

A browser extension that adds a "copy to clipboard" button to every code block on *GitHub, MDN, Gist, StackOverflow, StackExchange, npm, and even Medium.*

Install for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecopy/fkbfebkcoelajmhanocgppanfoojcdmg) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecopy/).

# Closest

Similar to jQuery's `$.fn.closest` and `$.fn.parents`.
Finds the closest parent that matches a selector.

## Installation

    $ npm install closest

## API

### `closest(element, selector, checkSelf)`

* element - will check this elements parents
* selector - CSS selector to match parents
* checkSelf - check `element`.
  If falsey, will begin with `element.parentNode` and is synonymous to `$.fn.parents`.
  Otherwise, it's `$.fn.closest`.

Example:

```javascript
var closest = require('cosest');

closest(document.body, 'html') === document.documentElement
closest(document.body, 'body', true) === document.body
closest(document.documentElement, 'html') == null

var delegate = require('delegate-events');
var ul = document.querySelector('ul');
var n = 0;

var fn = delegate.bind(ul, 'li a', 'click', function(e){
  console.log(e.target);
  console.log(e.delegateTarget); // => "<a>"
  if (++n == 3) {
    console.log('unbind');
    delegate.unbind(ul, 'click', fn, false);
  }
}, false);
```

## API

### .bind(el, selector, type, callback, [capture])

  Bind and return a callback which may be passed to `.unbind()`.

### .unbind(el, type, callback, [capture])

  Unbind.

## Tests

* Run `npm test`.
* Open `test/index.html` in a browser.
* Open the js console and verify that interacting with the elements works as they say they should.

==========================================
# delegate

Lightweight event delegation.

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install delegate --save
```

If you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/delegate/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

```js
var delegate = require('delegate');
```

###### Browser (Standalone)

```html
<script src="dist/delegate.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Add event delegation

#### With the default base (`document`)

```js
delegate('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an element as base

```js
delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With a selector (of existing elements) as base

```js
delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

#### With an array/array-like of elements as base

```js
delegate(document.querySelectorAll('.container'), '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);
```

### Remove event delegation

#### With a single base element (default or specified)

```js
var delegation = delegate(document.body, '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegation.destroy();
```

#### With multiple elements (via selector or array)

Note: selectors are always treated as multiple elements, even if one or none are matched. `delegate()` will return an array.

```js
var delegations = delegate('.container', '.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e.delegateTarget);
}, false);

delegations.forEach(function (delegation) {
    delegation.destroy();
});
```

# dom-iterator

  Feature-rich, well-tested Iterator for traversing DOM nodes. A better version of [NodeIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator). Travels in both directions.

  Can be used in node.js with [mini-html-parser](http://github.com/matthewmueller/mini-html-parser).

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install matthewmueller/dom-iterator

  With node.js:

    $ npm install dom-iterator

## Example

```js
var it = iterator(node);
var next;

while (next = it.next(Node.TEXT_NODE)) {
  console.log(next.nodeValue) // next textnodes after node
}
```

## API

### `iterator(node, root)`

Initialize an iterator starting on the `node`. Optionally you can
specify a `root` to limit your traversal to a particular subtree.
`root` must be either a parent or an ancestor of `node`.

```js
var it = iterator(el.firstChild, el)
```

### `iterator#next([expr], [n])`

Gets the next DOM `node`. If no `node` exists, return `null`.
You may pass an expression `expr`, to grab the first node that
matches `expr`.

Additionally, you can pass a number to select the `nth` node.
Defaults to `1` or the `1st` node.

```js
var node = it.next()
// select the 2nd element node we come across
var next = it.next(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, 2)
```

Here's a look at how the DOM is traversed:

![next](https://i.cloudup.com/kl80e5axNP.png)

### `iterator#prev()`, `iterator#previous()`

Gets the previous DOM `node`. If no `node` exists, return `null`.
You may pass an expression `expr`, to grab the first node that
matches `expr`.

Additionally, you can pass a number to select the `nth` node.
Defaults to `1` or the `1st` node.

```js
var node = it.prev()
// select the 2nd element node we come across
var prev = it.prev(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, 2)
```

Here's a look at how the DOM is traversed:

![prev](https://i.cloudup.com/EkaCyvdwvF.png)

### `iterator.select(expr)`

iterate over nodes that pass the expression `expr`. The `expr` can be an
enum, number, string or function. If it's a number, the `nodeType` is compared.

This function can be chained where all expressions are OR-ed.

```js
it.select(Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
  .select(8)
  .select('nodeValue == "sloth"')
  .select(fn)
```

This is saying:

> select all element nodes or comment nodes
> or nodes with the nodeValue "sloth" or
> nodes that pass the function `fn`.

### `iterator.reject(expr)`

iterate over nodes that do not pass the expression `expr`. The `expr` can be an
enum, number, string or function. If it's a number, the `nodeType` is compared.

This function can be chained where all expressions are AND-ed.

```js
it.reject(Node.ELEMENT_NODE)
  .reject(8)
  .reject('nodeValue == "sloth"')
  .reject(fn)
```

This is saying:

> reject all element nodes and comment nodes
> and nodes with the nodeValue sloth and
> nodes that pass the function `fn`".

### `iterator.revisit(revisit)`

You can also skip over elements you already visited, by setting `revisit` to false. By default, `revisit` is set to `true`.

```js
it.revisit(false);
```

Here's how that would change the iterator:

**it.next():**

![next](https://i.cloudup.com/VX6BbZEuzf.png)

**it.prev()**

![prev](https://i.cloudup.com/NEKe6F4EUX.png)

### `iterator.opening()`

Jump to the opening tag of an element. This is the default.

```js
var dom = domify('<em>hi</em>');
var it = it(dom).opening()
it.next() // 'hi'
```

### `iterator.closing()`

Jump to the closing tag of an element

```js
var dom = domify('<em>hi</em>');
var it = it(dom).closing()
it.prev() // 'hi'
```

### `iterator.peek([expr], [n])`

Sometimes you want to peek on the following or previous node without actually visiting it. With `peek` you can peek forward or backwards `n` steps. If no `n` is given, peek forward 1 step.

Peaking forward:

```js
it.peek(); // peek forward 1
it.peek(3); // peek forward 3 steps
```

Peaking backwards:

```js
it.peek(Node.ELEMENT_NODE, -3) // peek backwards 3 steps, only selecting element nodes
```

### `iterator.reset([newNode])`

Reset the iterator to the original `node`. Optionally pass a `newNode` to start at.

```js
it.reset();
```

### `iterator.use(fn)`

Add a plugin to the iterator.

# faye-websocket

* Travis CI build: [![Build
  status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-websocket-node)
* Autobahn tests: [server](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/servers/),
  [client](http://faye.jcoglan.com/autobahn/clients/)

This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com) project. It provides classes for easily building
WebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but
rather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction
other than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).

It also provides an abstraction for handling
[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are
one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are
based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than
WebSockets.


## Installation

```
$ npm install faye-websocket
```


## Handling WebSocket connections in Node

You can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade
requests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes
the usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this
is how you'd implement an echo server:

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    http      = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {
  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {
    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);
    
    ws.on('message', function(event) {
      ws.send(event.data);
    });
    
    ws.on('close', function(event) {
      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
      ws = null;
    });
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the
`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:

```js
    ws.pipe(ws);
```

Note that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting
through an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you
call `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire
handshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer
the message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any
buffered messages will be sent to the client.

If you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the
`onopen` event.

If the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to
send a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a
message string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message
is received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the
client does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns
`false`.

```js
ws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {
  // fires when pong is received
});
```


## Using the WebSocket client

The client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`
protocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web
browser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.

```js
var WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),
    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');

ws.on('open', function(event) {
  console.log('open');
  ws.send('Hello, world!');
});

ws.on('message', function(event) {
  console.log('message', event.data);
});

ws.on('close', function(event) {
  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);
  ws = null;
});
```

The WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the
handshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.

To connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,
including any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you
require. Only the `origin` setting is required.

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {
  proxy: {
    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',
    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},
    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}
  }
});
```

The `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to
[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).


## Subprotocol negotiation

The WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application
protocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which
protocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you
construct the socket:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

On the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server
supports after the other constructor arguments:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);
```

If the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side
socket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.


## Protocol extensions

faye-websocket is based on the
[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
framework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an
array of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add
[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):

```js
var deflate = require('permessage-deflate');

var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});
```


## Initialization options

Both the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in
at initialization time, for example:

```js
var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);
var ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);
```

`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.
`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:

* `extensions` - an array of
  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)
  compatible extensions, as described above
* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to
  be sent during the handshake process
* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.
  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.
* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,
  measured in seconds

The client accepts some additional options:

* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above
* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin
  server, this will be passed to
  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)
* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`


## WebSocket API

Both server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.

* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is
  established. Event has no attributes.
* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a
  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`
  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).
* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error
  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,
  you do not need to implement error recover.
* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the
  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>
  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer
  that closed the connection.
* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a
  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.
* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional
  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.
* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status
  code and reason text, both of which are optional.
* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`
  protocol the connection is using.
* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol
  the socket is using.


## Handling EventSource connections in Node

EventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they
only allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.
EventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each
message has an optional event-type and ID.

```js
var WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),
    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,
    http        = require('http');

var server = http.createServer();

server.on('request', function(request, response) {
  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {
    var es = new EventSource(request, response);
    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);
    
    // Periodically send messages
    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);
    
    es.on('close', function() {
      clearInterval(loop);
      es = null;
    });
  
  } else {
    // Normal HTTP request
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    response.end('Hello');
  }
});

server.listen(8000);
```

The `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default
event-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`
event with ID `99`:

```js
es.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});
```

The `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:

* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the
  EventSource.
* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the
  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection
  to determine which messages need resending.

When you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass
configuration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:

* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the
  EventSource response.
* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it
  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.
* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send
  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts
  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.

For example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings
every 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:

```js
var es = new EventSource(request, response, {
  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},
  ping:    15,
  retry:   10
});
```

You can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike
WebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send
some data over the wire to keep the connection alive.

# good-listener

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/zenorocha/good-listener/master.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/zenorocha/good-listener)

> A more versatile way of adding & removing event listeners.

![good listener](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/398893/10718224/dfc25f6c-7b2a-11e5-9d3d-75b35e8603c8.jpg)

## Install

You can get it on npm.

```
npm install good-listener --save
```

Or bower, too.

```
bower install good-listener --save
```

If you're not into package management, just [download a ZIP](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/archive/master.zip) file.

## Setup

###### Node (Browserify)

```js
var listen = require('good-listener');
```

###### Browser (Standalone)

```html
<script src="dist/good-listener.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Add an event listener

By passing a string selector [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/selector.html).

```js
listen('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Or by passing a HTML element [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/node.html).

```js
var logo = document.getElementById('logo');

listen(logo, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Or by passing a list of HTML elements [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/nodelist.html).

```js
var anchors = document.querySelectorAll('a');

listen(anchors, 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

### Remove an event listener

By calling the `destroy` function that returned from previous operation [(see full demo)](https://github.com/zenorocha/good-listener/blob/master/demo/destroy.html).

```js
var listener = listen('.btn', 'click', function(e) {
    console.log(e);
});

listener.destroy();
```

grunt-contrib-watch@1.1.0 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE
==========================================
# grunt-contrib-watch v1.1.0 [![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch) [![Build Status: Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/olyu3uhcq59avm8v/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/branch/master)

> Run predefined tasks whenever watched file patterns are added, changed or deleted



## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-watch --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');
```




## Watch task
_Run this task with the `grunt watch` command._


### Settings

There are a number of options available. Please review the [minimatch options here](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#options). As well as some additional options as follows:

#### files
Type: `String|Array`

This defines what file patterns this task will watch. It can be a string or an array of files and/or minimatch patterns.

#### tasks
Type: `String|Array`

This defines which tasks to run when a watched file event occurs.

#### options.spawn
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

Whether to spawn task runs in a child process. Setting this option to `false` speeds up the reaction time of the watch (usually 500ms faster for most) and allows subsequent task runs to share the same context. Not spawning task runs can make the watch more prone to failing so please use as needed.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: ['**/*.js'],
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      spawn: false,
    },
  },
},
```

*For backwards compatibility the option `nospawn` is still available and will do the opposite of `spawn`.*

#### options.interrupt
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

As files are modified this watch task will spawn tasks in child processes. The default behavior will only spawn a new child process per target when the previous process has finished. Set the `interrupt` option to true to terminate the previous process and spawn a new one upon later changes.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      interrupt: true,
    },
  },
},
```

#### options.debounceDelay
Type: `Integer`  
Default: `500`

How long to wait before emitting events in succession for the same filepath and status. For example if your `Gruntfile.js` file was `changed`, a `changed` event will only fire again after the given milliseconds.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['jshint'],
    options: {
      debounceDelay: 250,
    },
  },
},
```

#### options.interval
Type: `Integer`  
Default: `100`

The `interval` is passed to `fs.watchFile`. Since `interval` is only used by `fs.watchFile` and this watcher also uses `fs.watch`; it is recommended to ignore this option. *Default is 100ms*.

#### options.event
Type: `String|Array`  
Default: `'all'`

Specify the type of watch events that triggers the specified task. This option can be one or many of: `'all'`, `'changed'`, `'added'` and `'deleted'`.

Example:
```js
watch: {
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: ['generateFileManifest'],
    options: {
      event: ['added', 'deleted'],
    },
  },
},
```

#### options.reload
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

By default, if `Gruntfile.js` is being watched, then changes to it will trigger the watch task to restart, and reload the `Gruntfile.js` changes.
When `reload` is set to `true`, changes to *any* of the watched files will trigger the watch task to restart.
This is especially useful if your `Gruntfile.js` is dependent on other files.

```js
watch: {
  configFiles: {
    files: [ 'Gruntfile.js', 'config/*.js' ],
    options: {
      reload: true
    }
  }
}
```


#### options.forever
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

This is *only a task level option* and cannot be configured per target. By default the watch task will duck punch `grunt.fatal` and `grunt.warn` to try and prevent them from exiting the watch process. If you don't want `grunt.fatal` and `grunt.warn` to be overridden set the `forever` option to `false`.

#### options.dateFormat
Type: `Function`

This is *only a task level option* and cannot be configured per target. By default when the watch has finished running tasks it will display the message `Completed in 1.301s at Thu Jul 18 2013 14:58:21 GMT-0700 (PDT) - Waiting...`. You can override this message by supplying your own function:

```js
watch: {
  options: {
    dateFormat: function(time) {
      grunt.log.writeln('The watch finished in ' + time + 'ms at' + (new Date()).toString());
      grunt.log.writeln('Waiting for more changes...');
    },
  },
  scripts: {
    files: '**/*.js',
    tasks: 'jshint',
  },
},
```

#### options.atBegin
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

This option will trigger the run of each specified task at startup of the watcher.

#### options.livereload
Type: `Boolean|Number|Object`  
Default: `false`

Set to `true` or set `livereload: 1337` to a port number to enable live reloading. Default and recommended port is `35729`.

If enabled a live reload server will be started with the watch task per target. Then after the indicated tasks have run, the live reload server will be triggered with the modified files.

See also how to [enable livereload on your HTML](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/blob/master/docs/watch-examples.md#enabling-live-reload-in-your-html).

Example:
```js
watch: {
  css: {
    files: '**/*.sass',
    tasks: ['sass'],
    options: {
      livereload: true,
    },
  },
},
```

Passing an object to `livereload` allows listening on a specific port and hostname/IP or over https connections (by specifying `key` and `cert` paths).

Example:
```js
watch: {
  css: {
    files: '**/*.sass',
    tasks: ['sass'],
    options: {
      livereload: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 9000,
        key: grunt.file.read('path/to/ssl.key'),
        cert: grunt.file.read('path/to/ssl.crt')
        // you can pass in any other options you'd like to the https server, as listed here: http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_createserver_options_secureconnectionlistener
      }
    },
  },
},
```


#### options.cwd
Type: `String|Object`  
Default: `process.cwd()`

Ability to set the current working directory. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. Can either be a string to set the cwd to match files and spawn tasks or an object to set each independently. Such as:
```js
options: {
  cwd: {
    files: 'match/files/from/here',
    spawn: 'but/spawn/files/from/here'
  }
}
```

To strip off a path before emitting events:
```js
options: {
  cwd: {
    files: 'a/path',
    event: 'a/path'
  }
}
```
This will strip off `a/path` before emitting events. This option is useful for specifying the base directory to use with livereload.


#### options.livereloadOnError
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`  

Option to prevent the livereload if the executed tasks encountered an error. If set to `false`, the livereload will only be triggered if all tasks completed successfully.

### Examples

```js
// Simple config to run jshint any time a file is added, changed or deleted
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    files: ['**/*'],
    tasks: ['jshint'],
  },
});
```

```js
// Advanced config. Run specific tasks when specific files are added, changed or deleted.
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    gruntfile: {
      files: 'Gruntfile.js',
      tasks: ['jshint:gruntfile'],
    },
    src: {
      files: ['lib/*.js', 'css/**/*.scss', '!lib/dontwatch.js'],
      tasks: ['default'],
    },
    test: {
      files: '<%= jshint.test.src %>',
      tasks: ['jshint:test', 'qunit'],
    },
  },
});
```

#### Using the `watch` event
This task will emit a `watch` event when watched files are modified. This is useful if you would like a simple notification when files are edited or if you're using this task in tandem with another task. Here is a simple example using the `watch` event:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: ['lib/*.js'],
    },
  },
});
grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath, target) {
  grunt.log.writeln(target + ': ' + filepath + ' has ' + action);
});
```

**The `watch` event is not intended for replacing the standard Grunt API for configuring and running tasks. If you're trying to run tasks from within the `watch` event you're more than likely doing it wrong. Please read [configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).**

##### Compiling Files As Needed
A very common request is to only compile files as needed. Here is an example that will only lint changed files with the `jshint` task:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    scripts: {
      files: ['lib/*.js'],
      tasks: ['jshint'],
      options: {
        spawn: false,
      },
    },
  },
  jshint: {
    all: {
      src: ['lib/*.js'],
    },
  },
});

// On watch events configure jshint:all to only run on changed file
grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {
  grunt.config('jshint.all.src', filepath);
});
```

If you need to dynamically modify your config, the `spawn` option must be disabled to keep the watch running under the same context.

If you save multiple files simultaneously you may opt for a more robust method:

```js
var changedFiles = Object.create(null);
var onChange = grunt.util._.debounce(function() {
  grunt.config('jshint.all.src', Object.keys(changedFiles));
  changedFiles = Object.create(null);
}, 200);
grunt.event.on('watch', function(action, filepath) {
  changedFiles[filepath] = action;
  onChange();
});
```

#### Live Reloading
Live reloading is built into the watch task. Set the option `livereload` to `true` to enable on the default port `35729` or set to a custom port: `livereload: 1337`.

The simplest way to add live reloading to all your watch targets is by setting `livereload` to `true` at the task level. This will run a single live reload server and trigger the live reload for all your watch targets:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    options: {
      livereload: true,
    },
    css: {
      files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],
      tasks: ['compass'],
    },
  },
});
```

You can also configure live reload for individual watch targets or run multiple live reload servers. Just be sure if you're starting multiple servers they operate on different ports:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  watch: {
    css: {
      files: ['public/scss/*.scss'],
      tasks: ['compass'],
      options: {
        // Start a live reload server on the default port 35729
        livereload: true,
      },
    },
    another: {
      files: ['lib/*.js'],
      tasks: ['anothertask'],
      options: {
        // Start another live reload server on port 1337
        livereload: 1337,
      },
    },
    dont: {
      files: ['other/stuff/*'],
      tasks: ['dostuff'],
    },
  },
});
```

##### Enabling Live Reload in Your HTML
Once you've started a live reload server you'll be able to access the live reload script. To enable live reload on your page, add a script tag before your closing `</body>` tag pointing to the `livereload.js` script:

```html
<script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
```

Feel free to add this script to your template situation and toggle with some sort of `dev` flag.

##### Using Live Reload with the Browser Extension
Instead of adding a script tag to your page, you can live reload your page by installing a browser extension. Please visit [how do I install and use the browser extensions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) for help installing an extension for your browser.

Once installed please use the default live reload port `35729` and the browser extension will automatically reload your page without needing the `<script>` tag.

##### Using Connect Middleware
Since live reloading is used when developing, you may want to disable building for production (and are not using the browser extension). One method is to use Connect middleware to inject the script tag into your page. Try the [connect-livereload](https://github.com/intesso/connect-livereload) middleware for injecting the live reload script into your page.

##### Rolling Your Own Live Reload
Live reloading is made easy by the library [tiny-lr](https://github.com/mklabs/tiny-lr). It is encouraged to read the documentation for `tiny-lr`. If you would like to trigger the live reload server yourself, simply POST files to the URL: `http://localhost:35729/changed`. Or if you rather roll your own live reload implementation use the following example:

```js
// Create a live reload server instance
var lrserver = require('tiny-lr')();

// Listen on port 35729
lrserver.listen(35729, function(err) { console.log('LR Server Started'); });

// Then later trigger files or POST to localhost:35729/changed
lrserver.changed({body:{files:['public/css/changed.css']}});
```

##### Live Reload with Preprocessors
Any time a watched file is edited with the `livereload` option enabled, the file will be sent to the live reload server. Some edited files you may desire to have sent to the live reload server, such as when preprocessing (`sass`, `less`, `coffeescript`, etc). As any file not recognized will reload the entire page as opposed to just the `css` or `javascript`.

The solution is to point a `livereload` watch target to your destination files:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  sass: {
    dev: {
      src: ['src/sass/*.sass'],
      dest: 'dest/css/index.css',
    },
  },
  watch: {
    sass: {
      // We watch and compile sass files as normal but don't live reload here
      files: ['src/sass/*.sass'],
      tasks: ['sass'],
    },
    livereload: {
      // Here we watch the files the sass task will compile to
      // These files are sent to the live reload server after sass compiles to them
      options: { livereload: true },
      files: ['dest/**/*'],
    },
  },
});
```

### FAQs

#### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?
This is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is very low (256). Temporarily increase your limit with `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the new max limit.

In some versions of OSX the above solution doesn't work. In that case try `launchctl limit maxfiles 10480 10480 ` and restart your terminal. See [here](http://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6).

#### Can I use this with Grunt v0.3?
`grunt-contrib-watch@0.1.x` is compatible with Grunt v0.3 but it is highly recommended to upgrade Grunt instead.

#### Why is the watch devouring all my memory/cpu?
Likely because of an enthusiastic pattern trying to watch thousands of files. Such as `'**/*.js'` but forgetting to exclude the `node_modules` folder with `'!**/node_modules/**'`. Try grouping your files within a subfolder or be more explicit with your file matching pattern.

Another reason if you're watching a large number of files could be the low default `interval`. Try increasing with `options: { interval: 5007 }`. Please see issues [#35](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/issues/35) and [#145](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch/issues/145) for more information.

#### Why spawn as child processes as a default?
The goal of this watch task is as files are changed, run tasks as if they were triggered by the user himself or herself. Each time a user runs `grunt` a process is spawned and tasks are ran in succession. In an effort to keep the experience consistent and continually produce expected results, this watch task spawns tasks as child processes by default.

Sandboxing task runs also allows this watch task to run more stable over long periods of time. As well as more efficiently with more complex tasks and file structures.

Spawning does cause a performance hit (usually 500ms for most environments). It also cripples tasks that rely on the watch task to share the context with each subsequent run (i.e., reload tasks). If you would like a faster watch task or need to share the context please set the `spawn` option to `false`. Just be aware that with this option enabled, the watch task is more prone to failure.

#### How can I have the browser reload for files listed in a task?
Instead of restarting your server each time a static file is changed, start a static web server using (grunt-contrib-connect)[https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect].

You'll have the `connect` web server on seperate port ex: port 9000 from your main server. When the 'livereload' option is enabled for 'watch' tasks, it will handle triggerring the live reload server for each tasks and when files are modified, which then server back to main server ex: 3000. The main server must include a script tag or a browser extension to the livereload server in order for the browser automatically.

methods
=======

var hat = require('hat');

hat(bits=128, base=16)
----------------------

Generate a random ID string with `bits` of data in a `base`.

Leading zeros are appended such that all outputs for a given number of bits have
equal length.

var rack = hat.rack(bits=128, base=16, expandBy)
------------------------------------------------

Make a new hat rack. Call `rack()` repeatedly to generate new IDs which are
checked for collisions.

If `expandBy` is specified, increment `bits` by this amount if too many
collisions occur. If `expandBy` isn't specified, `rack()` will throw if too many
collisions occur during generation.

Optionally call `var id = rack(data)` to store `data` at the new ID.

You can get the data out again with `rack.get(id)` and set the data with
`rack.set(id, value)`.

# inferno-vnode-flags

Inferno VNode Flags is a small utility library for [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno).

Usage of `inferno-vnode-flags` should be limited to assigning `VNodeFlags` and `ChildFlags` when using creating vNodes.

## Install

```
npm install --save inferno-vnode-flags
```

## Contents

**VNodeFlags:**
- `VNodeFlags.HtmlElement`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentUnknown`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentClass`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction`
- `VNodeFlags.Text`
- `VNodeFlags.SvgElement`
- `VNodeFlags.InputElement`
- `VNodeFlags.TextareaElement`
- `VNodeFlags.SelectElement`
- `VNodeFlags.Void`
- `VNodeFlags.Portal`
- `VNodeFlags.ReCreate` (JSX **$ReCreate**) always re-creates the vNode

**VNodeFlags Masks:**
- `VNodeFlags.FormElement` - Is form element
- `VNodeFlags.Element` - Is vNode element
- `VNodeFlags.Component` - Is vNode Component
- `VNodeFlags.VNodeShape` - mask for defining type


**ChildFlags**
- `ChildFlags.UnknownChildren` needs Normalization
- `ChildFlags.HasInvalidChildren` is invalid (null, undefined, false, true)
- `ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren` (JSX **$HasVNodeChildren**) is single vNode (Element/Component)
- `ChildFlags.HasNonKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasNonKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes non keyed (no nesting, no holes)
- `ChildFlags.HasKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes keyed (no nesting, no holes)

**ChildFlags Masks**
- `ChildFlags.MultipleChildren` Is Array

You can easily combine multiple flags, by using bitwise operators. A common use case is an element that has keyed children:

Inferno is an insanely fast, React-like library for building high-performance user interfaces on both the client and server.

## Description

The main objective of the Inferno project is to provide the fastest possible **runtime** performance for web applications. Inferno excels at rendering real time data views or large DOM trees.

The performance is achieved through multiple optimizations, for example:

- Inferno's own [JSX plugin](https://github.com/infernojs/babel-plugin-inferno) creates monomorphic `createVNode` calls, instead of `createElement`
- Inferno's diff process uses bitwise flags to memoize the shape of objects
- Child nodes are normalized only when needed
- Special JSX flags can be used during compile time to optimize runtime performance at application level
- Many micro optimizations

## Features

- Component driven + one-way data flow architecture
- React-like API, concepts and component lifecycle events
- Partial synthetic event system, normalizing events for better cross browser support
- Inferno's [`linkEvent`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/blob/master/README.md#linkevent-package-inferno) feature removes the need to use arrow functions or binding event callbacks
- Isomorphic rendering on both client and server with `inferno-server`
- Unlike React and Preact, Inferno has lifecycle events on functional components
- Unlike Preact and other React-like libraries, Inferno has controlled components for input/select/textarea elements
- Components can be rendered outside their current html hierarchy using `createPortal` - API
- Support for [older browsers](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno#browser-supports) without any polyfills
- defaultHooks for Functional components, this way re-defining lifecycle events per usage can be avoided

## Browser support
Since version 4 we have started running our test suite **without** any polyfills.
Inferno is now part of [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com/) open source program and we use their service for executing the tests.

InfernoJS natively supports the browsers listed below.

[![Build Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/Havunen.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/open_sauce/user/Havunen)


## Migration to v4
List of breaking changes can be found from [here](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/blob/master/docs/v4-migration.md)

## Benchmarks

- [JS Web Frameworks Benchmark - Round 6](http://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark6/webdriver-ts/table.html)
- [Isomorphic-UI-Benchmark](https://github.com/marko-js/isomorphic-ui-benchmarks)
- [1k Components](https://rawgit.com/infernojs/inferno/master/benchmarks/1kcomponents/index.html)

## Code Example

Let's start with some code. As you can see, Inferno intentionally keeps the same design ideas as React regarding components: one-way data flow and separation of concerns.

In these examples, JSX is used via the [Inferno JSX Babel Plugin](https://github.com/infernojs/babel-plugin-inferno) to provide a simple way to express Inferno virtual DOM. You do not need to use JSX, it's completely **optional**, you can use [hyperscript](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-hyperscript) or [createElement](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-create-element) (like React does).
Keep in mind that compile time optimizations are available only for JSX.

```jsx
import { render } from 'inferno';

const message = "Hello world";

render(
  <MyComponent message={ message } />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```
Furthermore, Inferno also uses ES6 components like React:

```jsx
import { render, Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Header!</h1>
        <span>Counter is at: { this.state.counter }</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

render(
  <MyComponent />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Because performance is an important aspect of this library, we want to show you how to optimize your application even further.
In the example below we optimize diffing process by using JSX **$HasVNodeChildren** to predefine children shape compile time.
Then we create text vNode using `createTextVNode`.

```jsx
import { createTextVNode, render, Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Header!</h1>
        <span $HasVNodeChildren>{createTextVNode('Counter is at: ' + this.state.counter)}</span>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

render(
  <MyComponent />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Inferno is by using [Create Inferno App](https://github.com/infernojs/create-inferno-app).

Alternatively, you can use the [Inferno Boilerplate](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno-boilerplate) for a very simple setup. For a more advanced example demonstrating how Inferno might be used, we recommend trying out [Inferno Starter Project](https://github.com/nightwolfz/inferno-starter) by [nightwolfz](https://github.com/nightwolfz/). For using Inferno to build a mobile app, try [Inferno Mobile Starter Project](https://github.com/Rudy-Zidan/inferno-mobile) by [Rudy-Zidan](https://github.com/Rudy-Zidan).

Core package:

```sh

## Third-party state libraries

Inferno now has bindings available for some of the major state management libraries out there:

- Redux via [`inferno-redux`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/dev/packages/inferno-redux)
- MobX via [`inferno-mobx`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/dev/packages/inferno-mobx)
- Cerebral via [`cerebral-view-inferno`](https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral-view-inferno)

## JSX

Inferno has its own [JSX Babel plugin](https://github.com/trueadm/babel-plugin-inferno).

## Differences from React

- Inferno is much smaller in size, `~8kb` vs `45kb` gzip. This means Inferno is faster to transfer over the network but more importantly, it is *much* faster to parse – this makes a big impact on mobile.
- Inferno is considerably faster than React. This doesn't apply to benchmarks only, but to real-world applications that companies have converted to Inferno from React as well. Ranging from 40% - 110% performance improvement with Inferno `1.0`. No other React-like library gets close to this performance gain over React.
- Inferno doesn't have a fully synthetic event system like React does. Inferno has a partially synthetic event system, instead opting to only delegate certain events (such as `onClick`).
- Inferno doesn't support React Native. Inferno was only designed for the browser/server with the DOM in mind.
- Inferno doesn't support string refs – although this can be enabled using `inferno-compat`. We don't recommend using them since they are the source of many memory leaks and performance issues in real-world apps. Stick with function callback refs instead.
- Inferno includes `render` on the main core package, rather than have an `InfernoDOM` package like React does. We used to do it that way, but we found people simply didn't like it given we don't support native. Furthermore, by not splitting them, we improved performance and bundle sizes.
- Inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components. This is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than ES2015 classes.
- Inferno is able to use the React Dev Tools extensions for Chrome/Firefox/etc to provide the same level of debugging experience to the Inferno user via `inferno-devtools`.

## Differences from Preact

- Inferno is larger in size, `~8kb` vs `3kb` gzip. This means that Preact should parse faster than Inferno – if only slightly.
- Inferno has a partial synthetic event system, resulting in better performance via delegation of certain events.
- Inferno is *much* faster than Preact in rendering, updating and removing elements from the DOM. Inferno diffs against virtual DOM, rather than the real DOM (except when loading from server-side rendered content), which means it can make drastic improvements. Unfortunately, diffing against the real DOM has a 30-40% overhead cost in operations.
- Inferno fully supports controlled components for `input`/`select`/`textarea` elements. This prevents lots of edgecases where the virtual DOM is not the source of truth (it should always be). Preact pushes the source of truth to the DOM itself.
- Inferno provides lifecycle events on functional components. This is a major win for people who prefer lightweight components rather than ES2015 classes.

## Event System

Like React, Inferno also uses a light-weight synthetic event system in certain places (although both event systems differ massively). Inferno's event system provides highly efficient delegation and an event helper called [`linkEvent`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/blob/master/README.md#linkevent-package-inferno).

One major difference between Inferno and React is that Inferno does not rename events or change how they work by default. Inferno only specifies that events should be camel cased, rather than lower case. Lower case events will bypass
Inferno's event system in favour of using the native event system supplied by the browser. For example, when detecting changes on an `<input>` element, in React you'd use `onChange`, with Inferno you'd use `onInput` instead (the
native DOM event is `oninput`).

Available synthetic events are:
- `onClick`
- `onDblClick`
- `onMouseMove`
- `onMouseDown`
- `onMouseUp`
- `onSubmit`
- `onKeyPress`
- `onKeyDown`
- `onKeyUp`
- `onInput`
- `onChange`
- `onFocusIn`
- `onFocusOut`

### `linkEvent` (package: `inferno`)

`linkEvent()` is a helper function that allows attachment of `props`/`state`/`context` or other data to events without needing to `bind()` them or use arrow functions/closures. This is extremely useful when dealing with events in functional components. Below is an example:

```jsx
import { linkEvent } from 'inferno';

function handleClick(props, event) {
  props.validateValue(event.target.value);
}

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div><input type="text" onClick={ linkEvent(props, handleClick) } /><div>;
}
```

This is an example of using it with ES2015 classes:


```jsx
import { linkEvent, Component } from 'inferno';

function handleClick(instance, event) {
  instance.setState({ data: event.target.value });
}

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render () {
    return <div><input type="text" onClick={ linkEvent(this, handleClick) } /><div>;
  }
}
```

`linkEvent()` offers better performance than binding an event in a class constructor and using arrow functions, so use it where possible.


## Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.
In Inferno, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`.

We can combine the two by making the Inferno state be the "single source of truth". Then the Inferno component that renders a form also
controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by
Inferno in this way is called a "controlled component".

## Inferno Top-Level API

### `render` (package: `inferno`)

```javascript
import { render } from 'inferno';

render(<div />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Render a virtual node into the DOM in the supplied container given the supplied virtual DOM. If the virtual node was previously rendered
into the container, this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary, to reflect the latest Inferno virtual node.

Warning: If the container element is not empty before rendering, the content of the container will be overwritten on the initial render.

### `createRenderer` (package: `inferno`)

`createRenderer` creates an alternative render function with a signature matching that of the first argument passed to a reduce/scan function. This allows for easier integration with reactive programming libraries, like [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) and [Most](https://github.com/cujojs/most).

```javascript
import { createRenderer } from 'inferno';
import { scan, map } from 'most';

const renderer = createRenderer();


// NOTE: vNodes$ represents a stream of virtual DOM node updates
scan(renderer, document.getElementById("app"), vNodes$);
```

See [inferno-most-fp-demo](https://github.com/joshburgess/inferno-most-fp-demo) for an example of how to build an app architecture around this.

### `createElement` (package: `inferno-create-element`)

Creates an Inferno VNode using a similar API to that found with React's `createElement()`

```javascript
import { Component, render } from 'inferno';
import { createElement } from 'inferno-create-element';

class BasicComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return createElement('div', {
        className: 'basic'
      },
      createElement('span', {
        className: this.props.name
      }, 'The title is ', this.props.title)
    )
  }
}

render(
  createElement(BasicComponent, { title: 'abc' }),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

### `Component` (package: `inferno`)

**Class component:**

```javascript
import { Component } from 'inferno';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    ...
  }
}
```

This is the base class for Inferno Components when they're defined using ES6 classes.

**Functional component:**

```javascript
const MyComponent = ({ name, age }) => (
  <span>My name is: { name } and my age is: {age}</span>
);
```

Another way of using defaultHooks.
```javascript
export function Static() {
    return <div>1</div>;
}

Static.defaultHooks = {
    onComponentShouldUpdate() {
        return false;
    }
};
```

Functional components are first-class functions where their first argument is the `props` passed through from their parent.

### `createVNode` (package: `inferno`)
```js
import { createVNode } from 'inferno';

createVNode(
  flags,
  type,
  [className],
  [...children],
  [childFlags],
  [props],
  [key],
  [ref]
)
```

createVNode is used to create html element's virtual node object. Typically `createElement()` (package: `inferno-create-element`), `h()` (package: `inferno-hyperscript`) or JSX are used to create
`VNode`s for Inferno, but under the hood they all use `createVNode()`. Below is an example of `createVNode` usage:

```javascript
import { VNodeFlags, ChildFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';
import { createVNode, createTextVNode, render } from 'inferno';

const vNode = createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', createTextVNode('Hello world!'), ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren);

// <div class="example">Hello world!</div>

render(vNode, container);
```

`createVNode` arguments explained:

`flags`: (number) is a value from [`VNodeFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this is a numerical value that tells Inferno what the VNode describes on the page.

`type`: (string) is tagName for element for example 'div'

`className`: (string) is the class attribute ( it is separated from props because it is the most commonly used property )

`children`: (vNode[]|vNode) is one or array of vNodes to be added as children for this vNode

`childFlags`: (number) is a value from [`ChildFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this tells inferno shape of the children so normalization process can be skipped.

`props`: (Object) is object containing all other properties. fe: `{onClick: method, 'data-attribute': 'Hello Community!}`

`key`: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

`ref`: (function) callback which is called when DOM node is added/removed from DOM.


### `createComponentVNode` (package: 'inferno')
```js
import { createComponentVNode } from 'inferno';

createComponentVNode(
  flags,
  type,
  [props],
  [key],
  [ref]
)
```

createComponentVNode is used for creating vNode for Class/Functional Component.

Example:
```javascript
import { VNodeFlags, ChildFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';
import { createVNode, createTextVNode, createComponentVNode, render } from 'inferno';

function MyComponent(props, context) {
  return createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', createTextVNode(props.greeting), ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren);
}

const vNode = createComponentVNode(VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction, MyComponent, {
  greeting: 'Hello Community!'
}, null, {
  onComponentDidMount() {
    console.log("example of did mount hook!")
  }
})

// <div class="example">Hello Community!</div>

render(vNode, container);
```


`createComponentVNode` arguments explained:

`flags`: (number) is a value from [`VNodeFlags`](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno/tree/master/packages/inferno-vnode-flags), this is a numerical value that tells Inferno what the VNode describes on the page.

`type`: (Function/Class) is the class or function prototype for Component

`props`: (Object) properties passed to Component, can be anything

`key`: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

`ref`: (Function|Object) this property is object for Functional Components defining all its lifecycle methods. For class Components this is function callback for ref.



### `createTextVNode` (package: 'inferno')

createTextVNode is used for creating vNode for text nodes.

`createTextVNode` arguments explained:
text: (string) is a value for text node to be created.
key: (string|number) unique key within this vNodes siblings to identify it during keyed algorithm.

```js
import { createTextVNode } from 'inferno';

createTextVNode(
  text,
  key
)
```


### `cloneVNode` (package: `inferno-clone-vnode`)

This package has same API as React.cloneElement

```javascript
import {cloneVNode} from 'inferno-clone-vnode';

cloneVNode(
  vNode,
  [props],
  [...children]
)
```

Clone and return a new Inferno `VNode` using a `VNode` as the starting point. The resulting `VNode` will have the original `VNode`'s props with the new props merged in shallowly. New children will replace existing children. key and ref from the original `VNode` will be preserved.

`cloneVNode()` is almost equivalent to:
```jsx
<VNode.type {...VNode.props} {...props}>{children}</VNode.type>
```

An example of using `cloneVNode`:

```javascript
import { cloneVNode, createVNode, render } from 'inferno';
import { VNodeFlags } from 'inferno-vnode-flags';

const vNode = createVNode(VNodeFlags.HtmlElement, 'div', 'example', 'Hello world!');
const newVNode = cloneVNode(vNode, { id: 'new' }); // we are adding an id prop to the VNode

render(newVNode, container);
```

If you're using JSX:

```jsx
import { render, cloneVNode } from 'inferno';

const vNode = <div className="example">Hello world</div>;
const newVNode = cloneVNode(vNode, { id: 'new' }); // we are adding an id prop to the VNode

render(newVNode, container);
```

### `createPortal` (package: 'inferno')

HTML:
```html
<div id="root"></div>
<div id="outside"></div>
```

Javascript:
```jsx
const { render, Component, version, createPortal } from 'inferno';

function Outsider(props) {
	return <div>{`Hello ${props.name}!`}</div>;
}

const outsideDiv = document.getElementById('outside');
const rootDiv = document.getElementById('root');

function App() {
	return (
  	    <div>
    	    Main view
            ...
            {createPortal(<Outsider name="Inferno" />, outsideDiv)}
        </div>
    );
}


// render an instance of Clock into <body>:
render(<App />, rootDiv);
```

Results into:
```html
<div id="root">
    <div>Main view ...</div>
</div>
<div id="outside">
    <div>Hello Inferno!</div>
</div>
```
Cool huh? Updates (props/context) will flow into "Outsider" component from the App component the same way as any other Component.

### `hydrate` (package: `inferno`)

```javascript
import { hydrate } from 'inferno';

hydrate(<div />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Same as `render()`, but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by `inferno-server`. Inferno will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

### `findDOMNode` (package: `inferno-compat`)
This feature has been moved from inferno to inferno-compat in v4 forward. No options are needed anymore.

Note: we recommend using a `ref` callback on a component to find its instance, rather than using `findDOMNode()`. `findDOMNode()` cannot be used on functional components.

If a component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the corresponding native browser DOM element. This method is useful for reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values and performing DOM measurements.
In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using `findDOMNode()` at all. When render returns null or false, `findDOMNode()` returns null.

### Inferno Flags (package: inferno-vnode-flags)

**VNodeFlags:**
- `VNodeFlags.HtmlElement`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentUnknown`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentClass`
- `VNodeFlags.ComponentFunction`
- `VNodeFlags.Text`
- `VNodeFlags.SvgElement`
- `VNodeFlags.InputElement`
- `VNodeFlags.TextareaElement`
- `VNodeFlags.SelectElement`
- `VNodeFlags.Void`
- `VNodeFlags.Portal`
- `VNodeFlags.ReCreate` (JSX **$ReCreate**) always re-creates the vNode

**VNodeFlags Masks:**
- `VNodeFlags.FormElement` - Is from element
- `VNodeFlags.Element` - Is vNode element
- `VNodeFlags.Component` - Is vNode Component
- `VNodeFlags.VNodeShape` - mask for defining type


**ChildFlags**
- `ChildFlags.UnknownChildren` needs Normalization
- `ChildFlags.HasInvalidChildren` is invalid (null, undefined, false, true)
- `ChildFlags.HasVNodeChildren` (JSX **$HasVNodeChildren**) is single vNode (Element/Component)
- `ChildFlags.HasNonKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasNonKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes non keyed (no nesting, no holes)
- `ChildFlags.HasKeyedChildren` (JSX **$HasKeyedChildren**) is Array of vNodes keyed (no nesting, no holes)

ChildFlags Masks
- `ChildFlags.MultipleChildren` Is Array


### `renderToString` (package: `inferno-server`)

```javascript
import { renderToString } from 'inferno-server';

const string = renderToString(<div />);
```

Render a virtual node into an HTML string, given the supplied virtual DOM.

## Functional component lifecycle events

| Name                      | Triggered when                                                  | Arguments to callback           |
| -----------               | --------------                                                  | -----------------------         |
| `onComponentWillMount`    | a functional component is about to mount                        |                                 |
| `onComponentDidMount`     | a functional component has mounted successfully                 | `domNode`                       |
| `onComponentShouldUpdate` | a functional component has been triggered to updated            | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentWillUpdate`   | a functional component is about to perform an update            | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentDidUpdate`    | a functional component has performed an updated                 | `lastProps, nextProps`          |
| `onComponentWillUnmount`  | a functional component is about to be unmounted                 | `domNode`                       |

### Using functional lifecycle events

Functional lifecycle events must be explicitly assigned via props onto a functional component like shown below:

```javascript
import { render } from 'inferno';

function mounted(domNode) {
  // [domNode] will be available for DOM nodes and components (if the component has mounted to the DOM)
}

function FunctionalComponent({ props }) {
  return <div>Hello world</div>;
}

render(
  <FunctionalComponent onComponentDidMount={ mounted } />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Please note: class components (ES2015 classes) from `inferno` **do not** support the same lifecycle events (they have their own lifecycle events that work as methods on the class itself).

## Development vs Production modes

By default, Inferno will run in development mode. Development mode provides extra checks and better error messages at the cost of slower performance and larger code to parse.
When using Inferno in a production environment, it is highly recommended that you turn off development mode.

### Running Inferno on Node JS

Ensure the environment variable `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `production`.

### Building Inferno for use in a browser

When running Inferno on the browser using Webpack or Rollup, a replacement will need to occur during your build.

#### Webpack

Use the following configuration in your Webpack build for production build:

```js
  ...
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        'NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
      }
    })
  ]
```

When you are building for development, you may want to use `inferno.dev.esm.js` ("dev:module": "dist/index.dev.esm.js",) file.
That build version has extra level of validation for development purposes. You can use it by adding following code to your webpack config.

```js
    ...
	resolve: {
    /* When doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno */
		alias: {
			inferno: __dirname + "/node_modules/inferno/dist/index.dev.esm.js"
		}
	}
```

#### Rollup

Use the following configuration in your Rollup build:

```js
const replace = require('rollup-plugin-replace');
```

```js
  ...
  plugins: [
    replace({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production'),
    })
  ]
```

When you are building for development, you may want to use `inferno.dev.esm.js` ("dev:module": "dist/index.dev.esm.js",) file.
That build version has extra level of validation for development purposes. You can use it by adding following code to your rollup config.

```js
    const alias = require('rollup-plugin-alias');

    ...
	plugins: {
    /* When doing development workflow we want to make sure webpack picks up development build of inferno */
		alias: {
			'inferno': __dirname + '/node_modules/inferno/dist/index.dev.esm.js'
		}
	}
```

### Custom namespaces

Inferno always wants to deliver great performance. In order to do so, it has to make intelligent assumptions about the state of the DOM and the elements available to mutate. Custom namespaces conflict with this idea and change the schema of how different elements and attributes might work, so Inferno makes no attempt to support namespaces. Instead, SVG namespaces are automatically applied to elements and attributes based on their `tag name`.

## Goal and Philosophy

<img align="right" alt="Inquirer Logo" src="/assets/inquirer_readme.png" title="Inquirer.js"/>

**`Inquirer.js`** strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (and perhaps the "CLI [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane)").

**`Inquirer.js`** should ease the process of
- providing *error feedback*
- *asking questions*
- *parsing* input
- *validating* answers
- managing *hierarchical prompts*

> **Note:** **`Inquirer.js`** provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow. If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), [vorpal](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal) or [args](https://github.com/leo/args).


## [Documentation](#documentation)
<a name="documentation"></a>

### Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

``` shell
npm install inquirer
```

```javascript
var inquirer = require('inquirer');
inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */]).then(function (answers) {
	// Use user feedback for... whatever!!
});
```

<a name="examples"></a>
### Examples (Run it and see it)
Check out the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.

``` shell
node examples/pizza.js
node examples/checkbox.js
# etc...
```


### Methods
<a name="methods"></a>
#### `inquirer.prompt(questions) -> promise`

Launch the prompt interface (inquiry session)

- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)
- returns a **Promise**

#### `inquirer.registerPrompt(name, prompt)`

Register prompt plugins under `name`.

- **name** (string) name of the this new prompt. (used for question `type`)
- **prompt** (object) the prompt object itself (the plugin)

#### `inquirer.createPromptModule() -> prompt function`

Create a self contained inquirer module. If don't want to affect other libraries that also rely on inquirer when you overwrite or add new prompt types.

```js
var prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();

prompt(questions).then(/* ... */);
```

### Objects
<a name="objects"></a>

#### Question
<a name="questions"></a>
A question object is a `hash` containing question related values:

- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,
`list`, `rawlist`, `expand`, `checkbox`, `password`, `editor`
- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash. If the name contains periods, it will define a path in the answers hash.
- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.
Array values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).
- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.
- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.
- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.
- **pageSize**: (Number) Change the number of lines that will be rendered when using `list`, `rawList`, `expand` or `checkbox`. 

`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronous. Either return a promise or use `this.async()` to get a callback you'll call with the final value.

``` javascript
{
  /* Preferred way: with promise */
  filter: function () {
    return new Promise(/* etc... */);
  },

  /* Legacy way: with this.async */
  validate: function (input) {
    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback
    var done = this.async();

    // Do async stuff
    setTimeout(function () {
      if (typeof input !== 'number') {
        // Pass the return value in the done callback
        done('You need to provide a number');
        return;
      }
      // Pass the return value in the done callback
      done(null, true);
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

### Answers
<a name="answers"></a>
A key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.

- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object
- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)
  - `confirm`: (Boolean)
  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)
  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)

### Separator
<a name="separator"></a>
A separator can be added to any `choices` array:

```
// In the question object
choices: [ "Choice A", new inquirer.Separator(), "choice B" ]

// Which'll be displayed this way
[?] What do you want to do?
 > Order a pizza
   Make a reservation
   --------
   Ask opening hours
   Talk to the receptionist
```

The constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.

Separator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.

<a name="prompt"></a>
### Prompt types
---------------------

> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._

#### List - `{type: 'list'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)

![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)

---

#### Raw List - `{type: 'rawlist'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that
default must the choice `index` in the array)

![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)

---

#### Expand - `{type: 'expand'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`] properties. (Note that
default must be the choice `index` in the array. If `default` key not provided, then `help` will be used as default choice)

Note that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.

See `examples/expand.js` for a running example.

![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)
![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)

---

#### Checkbox - `{type: 'checkbox'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.

Choices marked as `{checked: true}` will be checked by default.

Choices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `"Disabled"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.

![Checkbox prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/checkbox-prompt.png)

---

#### Confirm - `{type: 'confirm'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.

![Confirm prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/confirm-prompt.png)

---

#### Input - `{type: 'input'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Input prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/input-prompt.png)

---

#### Password - `{type: 'password'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.

![Password prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/password-prompt.png)

---

#### Editor - `{type: 'editor'}`

Take `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties

Launches an instance of the users preferred editor on a temporary file. Once the user exits their editor, the contents of the temporary file are read in as the result. The editor to use is determined by reading the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables. If neither of those are present, notepad (on Windows) or vim (Linux or Mac) is used.

<a name="layouts"></a>
## User Interfaces and layouts


Along with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.

#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`

This UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.

```javascript
var ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();

// pipe a Stream to the log zone
outputStream.pipe(ui.log);

// Or simply write output
ui.log.write('something just happened.');
ui.log.write('Almost over, standby!');

// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader
// or output a progress bar, etc
ui.updateBottomBar('new bottom bar content');
```

<a name="reactive"></a>
## Reactive interface


Internally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.

This mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:

```js
var prompts = new Rx.Subject();
inquirer.prompt(prompts);

// At some point in the future, push new questions
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });
prompts.onNext({ /* question... */ });

// When you're done
prompts.onCompleted();
```

And using the return value `process` property, you can access more fine grained callbacks:

```js
inquirer.prompt(prompts).ui.process.subscribe(
  onEachAnswer,
  onError,
  onComplete
);
```

## Support (OS Terminals)
<a name="support"></a>

You should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't
look at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!

- **Mac OS**:
  - Terminal.app
  - iTerm
- **Windows**:
  - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
  - cmd.exe
  - Powershell
  - Cygwin
- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:
  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)
  - konsole

   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

--- Exceptions to the Apache 2.0 License ----

As an exception, if, as a result of your compiling your source code, portions
of this Software are embedded into an Object form of such source code, you
may redistribute such embedded portions in such Object form without complying
with the conditions of Sections 4(a), 4(b) and 4(d) of the License.

In addition, if you combine or link compiled forms of this Software with
software that is licensed under the GPLv2 ("Combined Software") and if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the patent provision (Section
3), the indemnity provision (Section 9) or other Section of the License
conflicts with the conditions of the GPLv2, you may retroactively and
prospectively choose to deem waived or otherwise exclude such Section(s) of
the License, but only in their entirety and only with respect to the Combined
Software.

raw-body@1.1.7 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE

# raw-body

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/method-override.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/raw-body)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stream-utils/raw-body)
[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/stream-utils/raw-body.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/stream-utils/raw-body)

Gets the entire buffer of a stream either as a `Buffer` or a string.
Validates the stream's length against an expected length and maximum limit.
Ideal for parsing request bodies.

## API

```js
var getRawBody = require('raw-body')

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  getRawBody(req, {
    length: req.headers['content-length'],
    limit: '1mb',
    encoding: 'utf8'
  }, function (err, string) {
    if (err)
      return next(err)

    req.text = string
    next()
  })
})
```

or in a Koa generator:

```js
app.use(function* (next) {
  var string = yield getRawBody(this.req, {
    length: this.length,
    limit: '1mb',
    encoding: 'utf8'
  })
})
```

### getRawBody(stream, [options], [callback])

Returns a thunk for yielding with generators.

Options:

- `length` - The length length of the stream.
  If the contents of the stream do not add up to this length,
  an `400` error code is returned.
- `limit` - The byte limit of the body.
  If the body ends up being larger than this limit,
  a `413` error code is returned.
- `encoding` - The requested encoding.
  By default, a `Buffer` instance will be returned.
  Most likely, you want `utf8`.
  You can use any type of encoding supported by [StringDecoder](http://nodejs.org/api/string_decoder.html).
  You can also pass `true` which sets it to the default `utf8`

`callback(err, res)`:

- `err` - the following attributes will be defined if applicable:

    - `limit` - the limit in bytes
    - `length` and `expected` - the expected length of the stream
    - `received` - the received bytes
    - `status` and `statusCode` - the corresponding status code for the error
    - `type` - either `entity.too.large`, `request.size.invalid`, or `stream.encoding.set`

- `res` - the result, either as a `String` if an encoding was set or a `Buffer` otherwise.

If an error occurs, the stream will be paused,
and you are responsible for correctly disposing the stream.
For HTTP requests, no handling is required if you send a response.
For streams that use file descriptors, you should `stream.destroy()` or `stream.close()` to prevent leaks.
